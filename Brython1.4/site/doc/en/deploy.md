Deploying a Brython application on a server
-------------------------------------------

For deployment on a web server accessible to users of your application, you don't have to install all the development environment

In the [downloads page](https://bitbucket.org/olemis/brython/downloads), choose one of the archives (zip, gz or bz2) called _Brython-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_ ; unpack it and upload its content to the directory where you want to install your Brython application

This packages only holds the Brython distribution : __brython.js__ and the built-in libraries in directories __libs__ and __Lib__
